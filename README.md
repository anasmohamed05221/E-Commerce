## 📌 What This Is

A hands-on built backend for an e-commerce platform — **no scaffolding, no boilerplate generators**. Every model, service, route, migration, and test is written intentionally to learn and demonstrate real backend engineering.

> 🚧 **Active Development** — Core commerce features (cart, orders, checkout) are being built now.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Request → Middleware (logging, rate limit, request ID)
       → Router (validation, HTTP contract)
       → Service (business logic)
       → Model (SQLAlchemy ORM → PostgreSQL)
       → Response
```

**3-layer separation** — routers never touch the DB directly, services own the logic, models own the data.

| Pattern | Where |
|---|---|
| Dependency Injection | DB sessions, authenticated user context |
| Token Rotation | Refresh tokens revoked on reuse |
| Cache-Aside | Redis → DB fallback for categories |
| Soft Deletes | Users deactivated, not destroyed |
| Historical Pricing | `price_at_time` on order items |

---

## 🔐 Auth System

Full authentication pipeline — not a tutorial copy-paste.

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Registration | Email + password with validation |
| Email Verification | 6-digit code, time-limited |
| Login | JWT access token (15 min) + refresh token (7 days) |
| Token Rotation | Old refresh token revoked on each refresh |
| Password Change | Confirmation email with approve/deny links |
| Password Reset | Forgot-password flow with time-limited token |
| Logout | Single device or all devices (revoke all tokens) |
| Account Deactivation | Soft delete + full token revocation |
| RBAC | Role field on user (customer, admin) |
| Rate Limiting | Per-endpoint limits (e.g. login: 5/min, register: 3/min) |

Tokens are **hashed in the database** (SHA-256 of JTI). Passwords use **bcrypt**.

| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Logout |
| `POST` | `/auth/forgot-password` | Request password reset |
| `POST` | `/auth/reset-password` | Reset password |

### Users `/users` 🔒
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/users/me` | Current user profile |
| `PUT` | `/users/me/password` | Request password change |

## 🗄️ Data Model

```
users ──┬── refresh_tokens
        ├── orders ── order_items ── products
        └── cart_items ─────────────── products ── inventory_changes
                                         └── categories
```

**8 tables** — users, products, categories, orders, order_items, cart_items, refresh_tokens, inventory_changes — managed through **11 Alembic migrations**.

---

## 🧪 Testing

```
tests/
├── unit/           → hashing, tokens, verification, sanitization
├── integration/    → user CRUD, token rotation, products, categories
├── api/
│   ├── auth/       → register, login, logout, verify, refresh, reset
│   ├── users/      → profile, password change, deactivation
│   ├── products/   → list, detail
│   └── categories/ → list
└── middleware/     → rate limiting
```

- **27 test files** across 4 layers
- SQLite in-memory DB for isolation
- AsyncMock Redis for cache testing
- CI runs on every push via **GitHub Actions**

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### ✅ Done
- [x] User registration, email verification, JWT auth with token rotation
- [x] Password change (with email confirmation) and reset flows
- [x] Account deactivation with full token revocation
- [x] Product catalog — list with pagination/filtering, detail view
- [x] Categories with Redis caching
- [x] Rate limiting, structured logging, request ID tracing
- [x] RBAC groundwork (role field, middleware-ready)
- [x] 27-file test suite (unit → integration → API → middleware)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI pipeline

### 🔨 Building Now
- [ ] Shopping cart (DB-backed, schemas + service in progress)
- [ ] Order & checkout flow
- [ ] Inventory management (stock tracking model exists)

### 📅 Up Next
- [ ] Admin endpoints (product/category CRUD, order management)
- [ ] Payment gateway simulation
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Frontend integration (React/Next.js)
