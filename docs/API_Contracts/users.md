# Users API Contract

This document defines the API contract for user-related endpoints in the MVP version of the E-Commerce backend.

All endpoints require authentication unless stated otherwise.

---

  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "phone_number": "+201234567890"

}

---

## Notes

- Applies the pending password hash to the user's account.
- Revokes all active refresh tokens (forces re-login on all devices).
- Token is accepted in the request body (not as a URL query parameter) to prevent leakage in server logs and browser history.
